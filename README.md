## Installation

You can download the projects using the Package Manager Console:

     Install-Package CAPS.Notifications.Web
     Install-Package CAPS.Notifications.Web.Knockout
     
or download them from NuGet [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CAPS.Notifications.Web/) and [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CAPS.Notifications.Web.Knockout/)
     
Alternatively, you can use the compile projects from this repository. 

The Knockout package is optional but recommended if you want to learn how the client-side JavaScript can bind to the SignalR notifications.

## Setup

This setup assumes you have are using both the Core and Knockout Extensions. If you decide to not use Knockout Extensions then you will have to implement your own client-side handling for the notifications

### Implement INotificationHandler

Somewhere in your site you will have to implement the INotificationHandler interface and export your class using the <code>[Export]</code> attribute. The Knockout Extensions NuGet package automatically includes a sample class in **SampleNotificationHandler.cs**:

```csharp
[Export(typeof(INotificationHandler))]
public class SampleNotificationHandler : INotificationHandler
{
	private List<Notification> samples = new List<Notification>();

	public SampleNotificationHandler()
	{
		for (var i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
		{
			samples.Add(new Notification { Id = i.ToString(), Title = "Sample Notification " + i.ToString(), Text = "This is a sample notification", Image = "/Content/notifications/sign_warning.png", Url = "#", DateTime = DateTime.Now });
		}
	}

	public Task<IEnumerable<Notification>> GetForUserAsync(string username, int offset, int max)
	{
		return Task.FromResult(samples.Skip(offset).Take(max));
	}

	public Task<Notification> GetAsync(string id)
	{
		return Task.FromResult(samples.FirstOrDefault(n => n.Id == id));
	}

	public Task MarkAsReadAsync(string id)
	{
		var sample = samples.FirstOrDefault(n => n.Id == id);
		if (sample == null)
			throw new HttpResponseException(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
		sample.Read = true;
		return Task.Run(() => { });
	}
}
```

### Add CSS and JavaScript References

The Knockout extensions require the following CSS to be included on the page in order to work properly.

```html
<head>
    ...
    @Styles.Render("~/Content/css") <!-- Bootstrap -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/Content/jquery.gritter.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/Content/notifications/notifications.min.css" />
</head>
```

The following JavaScript files are also required:

```html
<body>
	...
	<script src="~/Scripts/jquery.signalR-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
    <!--Reference the autogenerated SignalR hub script. -->
    <script src="~/signalr/hubs"></script>
    <script src="~/Scripts/jquery.gritter.js"></script>
    <script src="~/Scripts/knockout-3.1.0.debug.js"></script>
    <script src="~/Scripts/knockout.mapping-latest.js"></script>
    <script src="~/Scripts/notifications/notifications.min.js"></script>
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/bootstrap")
</body>
```
Somewhere on your page you will also need the following script:

```js
var vm = new NotificationsViewModel({ username: username, readType: 'click' });
ko.applyBindings(vm); // your Knockout bindings will probably be different
$.connection.hub.start().done(function () {
	vm.init();
});
```
### Add Partial Views

The Knockout extension assumes that Bootstrap is installed. 

To add the notification dropdown to the navbar:

```html
<div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top">
	<div class="container">
		...
		<div class="navbar-collapse collapse">
			...
			<ul class="nav navbar-nav pull-right">
				@{Html.RenderPartial("_NotificationDropdown");}
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

You then need to add the notification dialog to the page:
```html
@{Html.RenderPartial("_NotificationModal");}
```

### Without Knockout Extension

If you decide not to use the Knockout extension then you will have to make sure your web project includes the [Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb/) package in order to get the notification hub to automatically start and to bind to a <code>INotificationHandler</code>
